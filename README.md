# Introduction

This is a landing for related content for customers to get started using Azure in the context of medium to large enterprises. The content is pointers to videos and other content produced by teams inside Microsoft, from Core Services Engineering & Operations, to other internal engineering teams, to our field teams that are working with our large customers day in and day out.

The focus of *Azure in the Enterprise* is to serve the *practictioners* working on Azure day in and out, but *not* feature release information. That stuff is already greatly covered by shows such as [Azure Friday](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/videos/azure-friday/). *Azure in the Enterprise* is meant to focus on how to put the platform itself together to solve customer challenges.

What we're working on is below. Just a note - in general, we may put placeholders on content we're working on, and then adding the live links in when they're released, so don't freak out if a link isn't active yet - it means we're working on it now.

After our content listing - head down to the tools and links section for stuff you should be using TODAY, and other content from Microsoft.
