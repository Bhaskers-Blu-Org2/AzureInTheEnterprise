# Introduction

This is a landing for related content for customers to get started using Azure in the context of medium to large enterprises. The content is pointers to videos and other content produced by teams inside Microsoft, from Core Services Engineering & Operations, to other internal engineering teams, to our field teams that are working with our large customers day in and day out.

The focus of *Azure in the Enterprise* is to serve the *practictioners* working on Azure day in and out, but *not* feature release information. That stuff is already greatly covered by shows such as [Azure Friday](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/videos/azure-friday/). *Azure in the Enterprise* is meant to focus on how to put the platform itself together to solve customer challenges.

What we're working on is below. Just a note - in general, we may put placeholders on content we're working on, and then adding the live links in when they're released, so don't freak out if a link isn't active.

## Core Services Engineering & Operations (formerly Microsoft IT) Azure Workshop

Over the last few years, Microsoft's Core Services Engineering & Operations (CSE&O) has hosted dozens of workshops for customer engineers on our campus in Redmond, focused on accelerating adoption through face to face discussions with our leading engineers.

We've moved from 40k+ servers on premise to 95%+ in the Azure cloud today, with hundreds of subscriptions and a well though out distributed responsibility model where developers are empowered to go fast while central governance is provided by guard rails and automation. We consume more PaaS than IaaS, and take the approach of SaaS -> PaaS -> IaaS when thinking about workload placement.

We're bringing these experts to you through our YouTube series to help other large enterprises get started on Azure at scale.
